# Sum-Game
This is a simple implementation of "Sum" game done in "The Proteus" software tool.

# Conditions
The game is followed in such a way that the first two-digit number selected must be equal to the sum of two other two-digit numbers. <br>
So you will be able to choose three houses in each stage. <br>
The game starts from the player on the left and continues according to the turn and scoring discussed in the previous paragraph until the time of both players reaches zero. <br>
In the end, any player who has a higher score wins the game. <br>
In addition, another condition to win is to reach 10 points, and any player who reaches it first wins the game, and time will not matter anymore. <br>
